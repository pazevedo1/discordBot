#Count members function

###Video that helped me with this code was: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjfxYfKFXO8&t=339s  The code that I looked at for this is at 5:44 in the video ###

@client.command()
async def UserCount(ctx):
    id=client.get_guild(771303091936296970) #Gets the ID of the server 
    await ctx.channel.send(f"""The amount of members here is: {id.member_count}""") 
###Displays message saying how many users are in the server and does this by counting the amount of member ID's are in the server###

#Coin Flip function 

###For This coin flip function I used this video to get a good idea of the code needed for this function: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2mIfj3zi-M ######

@client.command()
async def Coinflip(ctx):
    result=random.choice(["Heads!!!","Tails!!!"])
    await ctx.channel.send(f"The result is {result}")
####End of the code inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2mIfj3zi-M ####
